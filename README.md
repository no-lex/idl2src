# idl2src

#### a GDL/IDL indexer for Sourcetrail

### Overview

idl2src intends to make it easier to visualize and understand IDL and GDL codebases,
using the Sourcetrail open-source code visualization program. idl2src uses the
GDL parser's intermediate debug output to generate information about an IDL/GDL
codebase, and uses this information to construct a Sourcetrail graph for easy
visualization.

idl2src is written in C++17 and contains an object-oriented architecture to carry
data between the two parts of the program. The first part, `parsegdl.cpp`, parses
the text files generated by GDL's debug functionality. The second part,
`parsestructs.cpp` uses the code-friendly structures created by parsegdl in
order to commit to a Sourcetrail database the symbols created by `parsegdl.cpp`.

### System Requirements

idl2src is written for Linux applications at this time, and requires a c++17
compiler. The dependencies for the idl2src binary are as follows:

* c++17
* make
